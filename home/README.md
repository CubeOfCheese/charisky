The project we demoed for our first hackathon, SacHacks.

Our webapp is inspired by a productivity app (https://www.forestapp.cc/en/)

Charisky was created with the idea of fusing charity and productivity in mind. The user bets their money based on their expected productivity, the game ends when the user finishes their timed goal and wins back their money, and if they don't win the bet, the money will be donated to charity instead.

Google App Engine is used to host the website.
