Our webapp is inspired by a productivity app (https://www.forestapp.cc/en/)
authorize.net (user begins by creating an account â†’ stored user credit information)

Charisky was created with the idea of fusing charity and productivity in mind. The user bets their money based on their expected productivity, the game ends when the user finishes their timed goal and wins back their money, and if they don't win the bet, the money will be donated to charity instead.
